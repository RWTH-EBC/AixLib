<p>This package presents the use of TCP-IP communication over sockets.</p>
<p>Initialy the package contained its own set of functions, written as part of a thesis by Georg Ferdinand Schneider at a time when no such implemetation existed. For this version you can refer to an older version of AixLib, specifically 0.5.2 as the last version which includes this implementation.</p>
<p>As the Modelica_DeviceDrivers over time incorporated such a functionality, with the help of Thomas Beutlich we switched to using the Modelica_DeviceDrivers.Communication.TCPIPSocketClient class.</p>
<p>We kept the model and the example as a documented application example.</p>
