<p>
For getting started have a closer look at the models <code>Components.TCPCommunicatorExample</code> 
and <code>Examples.ExampleClientLoop</code>. The first one shows how the procedure of starting a TCP
communication has to be done. The latter shows <code>Components.TCPCommunicatorExample</code> in a real Example, 
where the signal of a feedback-control system is send via TCP. The server needed for this example can be executed or compiled.
</p>
The source code for the server is provided alongside with this library in
<code>Components.ExampleClientLoop</code>.
 
 <h4>Compatibility</h4>
 The library and functions have been tested using Dymola 2015, Windows 7 and MS Visual Studio 2010 Professional.<p>
 Tests with OpenModelica failed due to MS Visual Studio specific statements
 in the external C-functions headerfile (\"#pragma comment\").<p>
 However our intention is to provide the full source code of the C-functions. Users opting to use open source Modelica implementations such as OpenModelica
 may rather consider instead of incoporating the C-code imidiately rather linking it
 as a static library (*.lib-file) as done for example in <code>Modelica.Blocks.Tables.CombiTable1D</code>.
