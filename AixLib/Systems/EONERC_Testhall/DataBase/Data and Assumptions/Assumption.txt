Use Data from 24.10.22 12pm to 24.10.23 12pm

Individual missing values ​​are supplemented by the previous value


Ambient Air Temperature:
	- unlogical sensor data at 14.11.22 (above 50°C) and between 10.12 to 15.12.22 (above 50°C)
	- approx T_amb=10°C at 14.11.22
	- approx T_amb=1°C from 10.12 to 15.12.22


Heat Flow for JN, CCA and CID are approx by monitoring data. Use monthly variating value to estimate dimension. 
Approx JN heat flow as Q_JN = (4*Q_CID - Q_CCA) (four times because of area relation of office and hall1)

CPH Hall2:

	QFlow:
		- Unlogical Values from second 3974400 to 6598800 at TempOffSet, MassFlow and Temperatur, therefore the Temperature OffSet as QFlow is approximated with konstant values in this period
