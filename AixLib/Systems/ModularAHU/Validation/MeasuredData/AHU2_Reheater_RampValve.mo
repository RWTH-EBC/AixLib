  This record contains the measured data of a ramp of the three way
  valve. The investigated system is a reheater of an air handling unit
  (air handling unit 2 of the E.ON ERC test hall;

</p>
<p>
  The heating register is supplied by a mixing circuit with a
  three-way-valve.

<p>
  During the experiment the three-way-valve is slowly opened.
