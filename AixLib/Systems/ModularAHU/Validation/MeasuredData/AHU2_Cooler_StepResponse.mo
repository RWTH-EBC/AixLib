  Data of a step response experiment with the air handling unit 2
  (AHU2) Cooler
</h4>
<p>
  This record contains the measured data of a step response. The
  investigated system is a Cooler of an air handling unit (air handling
  unit 2 of the E.ON ERC test hall).
</p>
<p>
  The heating register is supplied by a mixing circuit with a
  three-way-valve.
</p>
<p>
  During the experiment the three-way-valve is fully openend until a
  steady-state is reached and closed afterwards.
</p>
<p>
  The experiment is performed for three different volume flow rates in
  the air canal of the air handling unit: 1000m^3/h, 2000m^3/h,
  3000m^3/h
</p>

  The record contains the following data points (columns):
