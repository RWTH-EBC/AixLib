<p>
This package provides basic interfaces for the definition of new refrigerant
models. Therefore, both partial packages of different refrigerant modelling
approaches and templates for these modelling approaches are provided in this
package. However, there is just one approach (i.e. <b>the hybrid approach</b>)
provided in this package by now.
