      a single-component medium.
      singleState is true if u and d do not depend on pressure, but only
      on a thermal variable (temperature or enthalpy). Otherwise, set it
      to false.
      For a single-substance medium, just set reducedX and fixedX to true,
      and there's no need to bother about medium compositions at all. Otherwise,
      set final reducedX = true if the medium model has nS-1 independent mass
      fraction, or reducedX = false if the medium model has nS independent
      mass fractions (nS = number of substances).
      If a mixture has a fixed composition set fixedX=true, otherwise false.
      The modifiers for reducedX and fixedX should normally be final
      since the other equations are based on these values.

      It is also possible to redeclare the min, max, and start attributes of
      Medium types, defined in the base class Interfaces.PartialMedium
      (the example of Temperature is shown here). Min and max attributes
      should be set in accordance to the limits of validity of the medium
      model, while the start attribute should be a reasonable default value
      for the initialization of nonlinear solver iterations.

  A refrigerant package inherits from
  <b>PartialHybridTwoPhaseMediumRecord</b> and provides the equations
  for the refrigerant. Moreover, the PartialHybridTwoPhaseMedium
  package inherits from <b>PartialMedium</b> and, therefore, the
  details of this package are described in <a href=
  \"modelica://Modelica.Media.UsersGuide\">Modelica.Media.UsersGuide</a>
