<ul>
  <li>This model is necessary to enable the agents to communicate with

  </li>
  <li>It needs to be placed in every system that uses agent-based
  control, similar to the \"System\" model in the Modelica.Fluid package

  <span style=
  \"font-family: MS Shell Dlg 2; color: #008000;\">Concept</span>
</h4>
<p>
  Every agent system needs a MessageNotification model in order to
  function, similar to the \"System\" model of the Modelica.Fluid
  library. The MessageNotification is responsible for ensuring that the
  agents receive their messages and update their inbox.
</p>
<p>
  There are two different possibilities to notify the agents when they
  receive a message. The standard one corresponds to earlier versions
  of the library and is set by setting usePoke=false in the
  MessageNotification models and all other agents in the system. When
  this setting is made, the UDP inbox of all agents gets updated every
  n seconds (n set by user). This is straight forward but also leads to
  time event generation (weak simulation performance). If usePoke is
  set to true, the Boolean sendOut connectors of every agent in the
  system needs to be connected to the Boolean receive[n] input of the
  MessageNotification model. With this method, the agents only update
  their inbox in case one agent has sent out a message. This reduces
  event generation during idle times of the agents and thus may
  increase simulation perfomance in systems with long idle times of the
  agents. Example images for both methods are provided below. For
  further information you can also refer to the example results.
