  <span style=\"color: #008000\">What you can do with this library</span>
</h4>
<p>
  The Modelica HVACAgentBasedControl presents a set of agents which can
  control building energy systems and systems of similar
  characteristics (e.g. district heating networks or electrical
  smart-grids). It offers a plug&amp;play solution to control systems
  with multiple energy suppliers. With the help of a market-based
  communication mechanism and cost functions for each energy supplier,
  the most cost effective supplier in the system is always chosen. With
  the help of individual cost functions the \"costs\" that should be
  minimized can be defined individually by the developer (e.g. money,
  primary energy, exergy destruction).

<h4>
  <span style=\"color: #008000\">How you set up your system with
  agent-based control</span>
</h4>
<p>
  If you want to control a building energy system with multiple
  heat/cold suppliers and multiple heat/cold consumers here is how you
  set up the system:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Equip each thermal zone with a RoomAgent just by placing an agent
  close to the zone in your model. The input of the room agent needs to
  be connected to a temperature sensor of the thermal zone
  </li>
  <li>Equip each heat/cold supplier with a Heat/ColdProducerAgent and a
  corresponding CostFunction. Make sure that the heat supplier is able
  to use the demanded capacity from the \"setCapacity\" output of the
  agent.
  </li>
  <li>Place a MessageNotification and a Broker anywhere in the model.
  </li>
  <li>Give each agent an individual five-digit number in the parameters
  under \"name\"(e.g. 1000X for the consumers, 20001 for the broker,
  3000X for the producers)
  </li>
  <li>Write down all names of the ProducerAgents in the \"startTable\" of
  the broker. Delete or add more lines if necessary.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  The system is now ready to go.
</p>
<h4>
  If you used older versions of this library, please add a
  MessageNotification agent to your agent-based systems in order to
  make them work. For more information please refer to <a href=
  \"HVACAgentBasedControl.Agents.MessageNotification\">MessageNotification
  model</a>.

<h4>
  <span style=\"color: #008000\">What can a building energy system with
  agent-based control look like?</span>
</h4>
<p>
  Below you see an example building energy system which can be found
  <a href=
  \"HVACAgentBasedControl.Examples.BuildingHeatingSystems.BuildingHeating\">
  here</a>. The system consists of two thermal zones (or rooms) and two
  heat producers e.g. a heat pump and a boiler. The system is set up as
  described in the section above. For a more detailed description
  please refer to the <a href=
  \"HVACAgentBasedControl.Examples.BuildingHeatingSystems.BuildingHeating\">
  model itself</a>. There are more examples available in the Example
  package if you need further input.
