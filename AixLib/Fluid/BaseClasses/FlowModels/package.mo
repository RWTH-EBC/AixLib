  This package contains a basic flow model that is used by the various
  models that compute pressure drop.
</p>
<h4>
  Assumption and limitations
</h4>
<p>
  Because the density does not change signficantly in heating,
  ventilation and air conditioning systems for buildings, the flow
  models compute the pressure drop based on the mass flow rate and not
  the volume flow rate. This typically leads to simpler equations
  because it does not require the mass density, which changes when the
  flow is reversed. Although, for conceptual design of building energy
  system, there is in general not enough information available that
  would warrant a more detailed pressure drop calculation. If a more
  detailed computation of the flow resistance is needed, then a user
  can use models from the <a href=
  \"modelica://Modelica.Fluid\">Modelica.Fluid</a> library.
</p>
<p>
  All functions have an argument <code>m_flow_turbulent</code> that
  determines where the flow transitions to fully turbulent flow. For
  smaller mass flow rates, the quadratic relation is replaced by a
  function that has finite slope near zero pressure drop. This is done
  for numerical reasons, and to approximate laminar flow, although the
  implementation does not use a linear function.
</p>
<h4>
  Implementation
</h4>
<p>
  The two main functions are <a href=
  \"modelica://AixLib.Fluid.BaseClasses.FlowModels.basicFlowFunction_dp\">
  AixLib.Fluid.BaseClasses.FlowModels.basicFlowFunction_dp</a> and
  <a href=
  \"modelica://AixLib.Fluid.BaseClasses.FlowModels.basicFlowFunction_m_flow\">
  AixLib.Fluid.BaseClasses.FlowModels.basicFlowFunction_m_flow</a> that
  compute the mass flow rate or the pressure drop, respectively. Both
  functions are two times continuously differentiable. First and second
  order derivatives are provided in the function that have the suffix
  <code>_der</code> and <code>_der2</code>.
