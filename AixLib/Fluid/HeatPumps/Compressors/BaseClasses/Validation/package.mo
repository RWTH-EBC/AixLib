  This package contains validation models for the classes in <a href=
  \"modelica://AixLib.Fluid.HeatPumps.Compressors.BaseClasses\">AixLib.Fluid.HeatPumps.Compressors.BaseClasses</a>.
</p>

  Note that most validation models contain simple input data which may
  not be realistic, but for which the correct output can be obtained
  through an analytic solution. The examples plot various outputs,
  which have been verified against these solutions. These model outputs
  are stored as reference data and used for continuous validation
  whenever models in the library change.
