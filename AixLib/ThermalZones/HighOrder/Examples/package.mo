 <p>Package with exemplary simulation setups for a room, an apartment and a one family dwelling. </p>
 <h4><span style=\"color:#008000\">Concept</span></h4>
 <p>The examples can be used to learn how to set up a simulation for these models (e.g. assumption for boundary conditions for a single room) and to compare the different CPU-times for simulations using the models.</p>
