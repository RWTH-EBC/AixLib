The hybrid approach is developed by Sangi et al. and consists of both the Helmholtz equation of state and fitted formula for thermodynamic state properties at bubble or dew line (e.g. p<sub>sat</sub> or h<sub>l,sat</sub>) and thermodynamic state properties depending on two independent state properties (e.g. T_ph or T_ps). In the following, the basic formulas of the hybrid approach are given. </p> <p> <b>The Helmholtz equation of state</b> </p> <p> The Helmholtz equation of state (EoS) allows the accurate description of fluids' thermodynamic behaviour and uses the Helmholtz energy as fundamental thermodynamic relation with temperature and density as independent variables. Furthermore, the EoS allows determining all thermodynamic state properties from its partial derivatives and its <b>general formula</b> is given below: </p> <p style=\"text-align:center;\"> <img src= \"modelica://AixLib/Resources/Images/Media/Refrigerants/Interfaces/Helmholtz_EoS.png\" alt=\"Calculation procedure of dimensionless Helmholtz energy\"> </p> <p> As it can be seen, the general formula of the EoS can be divided in two part: The <b>ideal gas part (left summand)</b> and the <b>residual part (right summand)</b>. Both parts' formulas are given below: </p> <p style=\"text-align:center;\"> <img src= \"modelica://AixLib/Resources/Images/Media/Refrigerants/Interfaces/Helmholtz_IdealGasPart.png\" alt= \"Calculation procedure of dimensionless ideal gas Helmholtz energy\"> </p> <p style=\"text-align:center;\"> <img src= \"modelica://AixLib/Resources/Images/Media/Refrigerants/Interfaces/Helmholtz_ResidualPart.png\" alt= \"Calculation procedure of dimensionless residual Helmholtz energy\"> </p> <p> Both, the ideal gas part and the residual part can be divided in three subparts (i.e. the summations) that contain different coefficients (e.g. nL, l<sub>i</sub>, p<sub>i</sub> or e<sub>i</sub>). These coefficients are fitting coefficients and must be obtained during a fitting procedure. While the fitting procedure, the general formula of the EoS is fitted to external data (e.g. obtained from measurements or external media libraries) and the fitting coefficients are determined. In order to keep the package clear and easy to extend, the fitting coefficients are stored in records inherited from the base data definition <a href= \"modelica://AixLib.DataBase.Media.Refrigerants.HelmholtzEquationOfStateBaseDateDefinition\"> AixLib.DataBase.Media.Refrigerants.HelmholtzEquationOfStateBaseDateDefinition</a> . </p> <p> For further information of <b>the EoS and its partial derivatives</b>, please read the paper \" <a href= \"http://www.ep.liu.se/ecp/076/006/ecp12076006.pdf\">HelmholtzMedia - A fluid properties library</a>\" by Thorade and Saadat as well as the paper\" <a href= \"http://gfzpublic.gfz-potsdam.de/pubman/item/escidoc:247373:5/component/escidoc:306833/247373.pdf\"> Partial derivatives of thermodynamic state properties for dynamic simulation</a>\" by Thorade and Saadat. </p> <p> <b>Fitted formulas</b> </p> <p> Fitted formulas allow to reduce the overall computing time of the refrigerant model. Therefore, both thermodynamic state properties at bubble and dew line and thermodynamic state properties depending on two independent state properties are expresses as fitted formulas.

The hybrid approach is developed by Sangi et al. and consists of both the Helmholtz equation of state and fitted formula for thermodynamic state properties at bubble or dew line (e.g. p<sub>sat</sub> or h<sub>l,sat</sub>) and thermodynamic state properties depending on two independent state properties (e.g. T_ph or T_ps). In the following, the basic formulas of the hybrid approach are given. </p> <p> <b>The Helmholtz equation of state</b> </p> <p> The Helmholtz equation of state (EoS) allows the accurate description of fluids' thermodynamic behaviour and uses the Helmholtz energy as fundamental thermodynamic relation with temperature and density as independent variables. Furthermore, the EoS allows determining all thermodynamic state properties from its partial derivatives and its <b>general formula</b> is given below: </p> <p style=\"text-align:center;\"> <img src= \"modelica://AixLib/Resources/Images/Media/Refrigerants/Interfaces/Helmholtz_EoS.png\" alt=\"Calculation procedure of dimensionless Helmholtz energy\"> </p> <p> As it can be seen, the general formula of the EoS can be divided in two part: The <b>ideal gas part (left summand)</b> and the <b>residual part (right summand)</b>. Both parts' formulas are given below: </p> <p style=\"text-align:center;\"> <img src= \"modelica://AixLib/Resources/Images/Media/Refrigerants/Interfaces/Helmholtz_IdealGasPart.png\" alt= \"Calculation procedure of dimensionless ideal gas Helmholtz energy\"> </p> <p style=\"text-align:center;\"> <img src= \"modelica://AixLib/Resources/Images/Media/Refrigerants/Interfaces/Helmholtz_ResidualPart.png\" alt= \"Calculation procedure of dimensionless residual Helmholtz energy\"> </p> <p> Both, the ideal gas part and the residual part can be divided in three subparts (i.e. the summations) that contain different coefficients (e.g. nL, l<sub>i</sub>, p<sub>i</sub> or e<sub>i</sub>). These coefficients are fitting coefficients and must be obtained during a fitting procedure. While the fitting procedure, the general formula of the EoS is fitted to external data (e.g. obtained from measurements or external media libraries) and the fitting coefficients are determined. Finally, the formulas obtained during the fitting procedure are implemented in an explicit form. </p> <p> For further information of <b>the EoS and its partial derivatives</b>, please read the paper \" <a href= \"http://www.ep.liu.se/ecp/076/006/ecp12076006.pdf\">HelmholtzMedia - A fluid properties library</a>\" by Thorade and Saadat as well as the paper \" <a href= \"http://gfzpublic.gfz-potsdam.de/pubman/item/escidoc:247373:5/component/escidoc:306833/247373.pdf\"> Partial derivatives of thermodynamic state properties for dynamic simulation</a>\" by Thorade and Saadat. </p> <p> <b>Fitted formulas</b> </p> <p> Fitted formulas allow to reduce the overall computing time of the refrigerant model. Therefore, both thermodynamic state properties at bubble and dew line and thermodynamic state properties depending on two independent state properties are expresses as fitted formulas. The fitted formulas' approaches implemented in this package are developed by Sangi et al. within their \"Fast_Propane\" model and given below:<br/> </p> <table> <caption> \"Formulas for calculating

it can be seen, the fitted formulas consist basically of the coefficients e<sub>i</sub>, c<sub>i</sub> as well as of the parameters Mean<sub>i</sub> and Std<sub>i</sub>. These coefficients are the fitting coefficients and must be obtained during a fitting procedure. While the fitting procedure, the formulas presented above are fitted to external data (e.g. obtained from measurements or external media libraries) and the fitting coefficients are determined. Finally, the formulas obtained during the fitting procedure are implemented in an explicit form. </p> <p> For further information of <b>the hybrid approach</b>, please read the paper \"<a href= \"http://dx.doi.org/10.3384/ecp14096\">A Medium Model for the Refrigerant Propane for Fast and Accurate Dynamic Simulations</a>\" by Sangi et al.. </p> <p> <b>Smooth transition</b> </p> <p> To ensure a smooth transition between different regions (e.g. from supercooled region to two-phase region) and, therefore, to avoid discontinuities as far as possible, Sangi et al. implemented functions for a smooth transition between the regions.
