<p>
This example demonstrates the use of the function for cubic hermite interpolation
and linear extrapolation.
The example use interpolation with two different settings: One settings
produces a monotone cubic hermite, whereas the other setting
does not enforce monotonicity.
The resulting plot should look as shown below, where for better visibility, the support points have been marked with black dots.
Notice that the red curve is monotonically increasing.

<p>
This example also tests the function for the situation where only <i>2</i> or
only <i>1</i> support points are provided.
In the first case, the result will be linear function and in the second case,
a constant value.
