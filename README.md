AixLib
======

**AixLib** is a Modelica model library for building performance simulations. It is being developed at [RWTH Aachen University, E.ON Energy Research Center, Institute for Energy Efficient Buildings and Indoor Climate (EBC)](http://www.ebc.eonerc.rwth-aachen.de/cms/~dmzz/E-ON-ERC-EBC/?lidx=1) in Aachen, Germany.

As the library is developed at RWTH Aachen University's EBC, the library's name **AixLib** is derived from the city's French name Aix-la-Chapelle, which the people of Aachen are very fond of and use a lot. With the name **AixLib** we follow this local tradition.

If you have any questions regarding **AixLib**, feel free to contact us at aixlib@eonerc.rwth-aachen.de.
